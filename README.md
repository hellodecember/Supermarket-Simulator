# Supermarket-Simulator
A program to simulate the checkout area of a Supermarket. The goal of this simulation is to collect statistical information about a store’s customers and cashiers. A checkout area consists of several cashiers and a customer waiting line (or queue). In each time unit, at most one new customer arrives at the waiting line. If the customer waiting line is too long, the customer leaves without checking out; otherwise, the customer gets into the waiting line. If all cashiers are busy, customers in the waiting lines must wait to checkout. If a cashier is free and customers are waiting, the first customer in the waiting line advances to the cashier’s counter and begins to checkout. When a customer is done, the customer departs and the cashier becomes free.
